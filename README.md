Three exercises in C showing communication between a server and client using TCP, UDP and Shared Memory.

1.	Implement a client process and a server process (concurrent) were the server and client send messages through TCP. For every message sent, print the number of bytes sent.

2.	Same as the previous exercise but using UDP and an iterative server.

3.	Same as the other two exercises but server and client communicate with each other using shared memory. Edit text messages in server and show them on the client.
